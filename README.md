# Grokking Algorithms - Study and Examples in C++

This repository contains my study of the book **"Grokking Algorithms"** by **Aditya Bhargava**. I am applying the concepts from the book by creating examples and implementations in C++ to learn more about algorithms and data structures.

## What you'll find in this repository

- C++ code examples based on the chapters of the **"Grokking Algorithms"** book.
- Explanations of the algorithms covered in each example.
- Notes and summaries of the concepts discussed.

## How to Run the Examples

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/grokking-algorithms.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd grokking-algorithms
    ```

3. Compile and run the C++ examples using your preferred compiler. If you use **g++**:

    ```bash
    g++ -o example example.cpp
    ./example
    ```

## Study Goals

The main goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of:

- Search and sorting algorithms.
- Graph algorithms and graph traversal.
- Data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- Programming techniques and algorithm analysis.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the examples or explanations, feel free to open an **issue** or submit a **pull request**.
