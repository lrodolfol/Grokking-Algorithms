# Grokking Algorithms - Study and Examples in C++

This repository contains my study of the book **"Grokking Algorithms"** by **Aditya Bhargava**. I am applying the concepts from the book by creating examples and implementations in C++ to learn more about algorithms and data structures.

## What you'll find in this repository

- C++ code examples based on the chapters of the **"Grokking Algorithms"** book.
- Explanations of the algorithms covered in each example.
- Notes and summaries of the concepts discussed.

## How to Run the Examples

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/grokking-algorithms.git
    ```

## Study Goals

The main goal of this repository is to deepen my understanding of:

- Search and sorting algorithms.
- Graph algorithms and graph traversal.
- Data structures like lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
- Programming techniques and algorithm analysis.
